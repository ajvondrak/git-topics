# Documentation

This directory contains the source of the git-topics man pages. The man pages
used in `git topics help` are generated by running
[ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/) on the files in this directory (cf. the
[build script](../build)). You can also peruse the markdown-formatted docs
directly via GitHub.
