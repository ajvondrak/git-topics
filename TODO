git topics setup
  hooks
    prevents untagged master pushes
    post-commit to trigger `git topics finish` in case of merge conflicts

git topics finish <name>
  git checkout master
  git pull?
  git merge --no-ff topic/<name>
  git checkout next
  git pull?
  git merge --no-ff topic/<name>
  git branch -d topic/<name>

git topics release <tag>
  check to make sure master doesn't have commits that aren't on next
  git tag <tag> master
  pre-populate tag message with the list of topics that are new to this tag

git topics [status]
  topics that haven't been closed (i.e., branches that haven't been deleted)
  whether they're merged in pu/next/master/maint
  pending release (if there are merges in master but master isn't tagged)

git topics log
  git log --first-parent
  how fancy can this get?

Speculative features
  git topics integrate <name>...
    clobber pu branch if it exists
    git checkout -b pu master
    git merge --no-ff topic/<name>...
  git topics depend <name>
    git merge topic/<name>
    presumably invoked while on some other topic branch
    feels largely unnecessary...
  git topics align (maybe git topics doctor?)
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git merge --no-ff next
    in theory, not really necessary
